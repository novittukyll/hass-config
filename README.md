## Introduction

My home assistant journey started roughly 2018 but was not very active for the first two years. I was happy with the default lovelace UI for a while until I started to notice projects that took a completely different way to design their dashboards.

Big insparation came from the [UI-Lovelace-Minimalist](https://github.com/UI-Lovelace-Minimalist/UI) project and from [@matt8707](https://github.com/matt8707/hass-config)'s nice design!

After learning how to use the excellent [button-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card) I came up with my current design for tablet and mobile. Yes, this design is heavily based on the button-card. Maybe I went a bit too deep with it...

Hope you enjoy and find things useful in this repo! ‚≠ê

## Setup

Home Assistant runs on [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/homeassistant/home-assistant) on a [Synology NAS](https://www.synology.com). Users access Home Assistant through the [Companion App](https://companion.home-assistant.io) on their mobile. In addition, the house has table mounted [10.5" Samsung Galaxy Tab A8](https://www.samsung.com/uk/tablets/galaxy-tab-a/galaxy-tab-a8-wifi-dark-gray-32gb-sm-x200nzaaeua/).

Configuration is performed using the YAML mode.

The following custom cards are extensively used throughout the dashboards:

- [button-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card)
- [mini-graph-card](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card)
- [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod)
- [layout-card](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-layout-card)
- [light-entity-card](https://github.com/ljmerza/light-entity-card)

Plus few others.
