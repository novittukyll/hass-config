# My Home Assistant config

![Screenshot](/assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Introduction

My home assistant journey started roughly 2018 but was not very active for the first two years. I was happy with the default lovelace UI for a while until I started to notice projects that took completely different approach on designing their dashboards.

Significant inspiration started when I came across [UI-Lovelace-Minimalist](https://github.com/UI-Lovelace-Minimalist/UI) project and further studied [@matt8707](https://github.com/matt8707/hass-config)'s great design!

After learning how to use the brilliant and very flexible [button-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card) by [@RomRider](https://github.com/RomRider) I came up with my current design for tablet and mobile. Yes, this design is heavily based on the button-card. Maybe I went a bit too deep with it...

Hope you enjoy and find things useful in this repo! ‚≠ê

## Setup

Home Assistant runs on [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/homeassistant/home-assistant) on a [Synology NAS](https://www.synology.com). Users access Home Assistant through the [Companion App](https://companion.home-assistant.io) on their mobile. In addition, the house has table mounted [10.5" Samsung Galaxy Tab A8](https://www.samsung.com/uk/tablets/galaxy-tab-a/galaxy-tab-a8-wifi-dark-gray-32gb-sm-x200nzaaeua/).

Configuration is performed using the YAML mode.

The following custom cards are extensively used throughout the dashboards:

- [button-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card)
- [mini-graph-card](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card)
- [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod)
- [layout-card](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-layout-card)
- [light-entity-card](https://github.com/ljmerza/light-entity-card)

Plus few others.

## Features

### Sidebar, notifications and clock

- Fancy sidebar clock with date, time and current weather condition and outdoor temperature
- Conditional notifications such as doors open, precipitation, Home Assistant and Synology updates etc.
- Notification badge in the home card (useful especially on mobile)

### Custom cards

I have created few [button card templates](button_card_templates/troinine) for my own needs. To mention few:

- Generic info card with extra entity
- Generic sensor card
- Graph sensor card (graph displayed with mini-graph-card)
- Sidebar clock with date, time and weather
- Light card with a slider
- User card with device tracker and battery statuses

All cards try to incorporate similar design. Icons can glow based on the state and the light card has a glowing box shadow when the respective light is on.

### Popups

Popups have been implemented using [browser_mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-browser_mod). Here are few examples:

Custom light popup with predefined scenes and color wheel:

## Hardware and software
