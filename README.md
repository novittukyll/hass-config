# My Home Assistant configuration

## Introduction

My home assistant journey started roughly 2018 but was not very active for the first two years. I was happy with the default lovelace UI for a while until I started to notice projects that took completely different approach on designing their dashboards.

Significant inspiration started when I came across [UI-Lovelace-Minimalist](https://github.com/UI-Lovelace-Minimalist/UI) project and further studied [@matt8707](https://github.com/matt8707/hass-config)'s great design!

After learning how to use the brilliant and very flexible [button-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card) by [@RomRider](https://github.com/RomRider) I came up with my current design for tablet and mobile. Yes, this design is heavily based on the button-card. Maybe I went a bit too deep with it...

Hope you enjoy and find things useful in this repo! ‚≠ê

## Setup

Home Assistant runs on [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/homeassistant/home-assistant) on a [Synology NAS](https://www.synology.com). Users access Home Assistant through the [Companion App](https://companion.home-assistant.io) on their mobile. In addition, the house has table mounted [10.5" Samsung Galaxy Tab A8](https://www.samsung.com/uk/tablets/galaxy-tab-a/galaxy-tab-a8-wifi-dark-gray-32gb-sm-x200nzaaeua/).

Configuration is performed mostly using YAML.

The following custom cards are extensively used throughout the dashboards:

- [button-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card)
- [mini-graph-card](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card)
- [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod)
- [layout-card](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-layout-card)
- [light-entity-card](https://github.com/ljmerza/light-entity-card)
- [weather-chart-card](https://github.com/Yevgenium/weather-chart-card)
- [apexcharts-card](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card)
- [xiaomi-vacuum-map-card](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card)
- [swipe-card](https://github.com/bramkragten/swipe-card)

In addition I have create the following cards for my own use as I couldn't find one that would suit my needs:

- [light-slider-card](www/troinine) (will publish this in its own repo in the future)

## Designs

### Mobile

The main principle on mobile is to avoid putting too much content in to a single page and avoid scrolling if possible. This is achieved by splitting the content into multiple views. As the typical navigation bar in Lovelace is on the top and is not that customizable, I ended up creating a bottom navigation bar component with a button card template.

There are currently four main views:

| Home | Lights | Devices | Notifications  |
|---|---|---|---|
| ![home](/assets/images/screenshot-mobile-home.png) | ![lights](/assets/images/screenshot-mobile-lights.png) | ![devices](/assets/images/screenshot-mobile-devices.png) | ![notifications](/assets/images/screenshot-mobile-notifications.png) |

Bottom navigation shows some badges that are related to that specific view. For example, the number of lights that are on and active notification count. Clicking notifications will show relevant content such as weather report or take the user to the vacuum popup.

Most cards also open a popup to show details. Here are few examples.

| Air quality | Lights | Vacuum | Remote |
|---|---|---|---|
| ![Air quality](/assets/images/screenshot-mobile-popup-air-quality.png) | ![Lights](/assets/images/screenshot-mobile-popup-lights.png) | ![Vacuum](/assets/images/screenshot-mobile-popup-vacuum.png) | ![Remote](/assets/images/screenshot-mobile-popup-remote.png) |

Popups often implement a swipable multi-panel content using [swipe-card](https://github.com/bramkragten/swipe-card) rather than scrollable content.

### Tablet

![Tablet](/assets/images/screenshot-tablet.png)

Tablet design is mostly inspired by [@matt8707](https://github.com/matt8707/hass-config)'s tablet dashboard but mostly all button-card templates are built from scratch for my needs. The tablet is sitting on a table stand in the entrance of the house. Easy accessibility makes it very convenient for kids to adjust their lights for example.

The tablet dashboards consists of a single view with many popups opening from titles and from cards. Here are few examples:

| ![Air quality](/assets/images/screenshot-tablet-air-quality-popup.png) | ![Devices](/assets/images/screenshot-tablet-devices-popup.png) | ![Devices](/assets/images/screenshot-tablet-vacuum-popup.png) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ![Heating](/assets/images/screenshot-tablet-heating-popup.png) | ![Light](/assets/images/screenshot-tablet-light-popup.png) | ![Weather](/assets/images/screenshot-tablet-weather-popup.png) |

## Features

### Sidebar, notifications and clock

- Fancy sidebar clock with date, time, current weather condition and outdoor temperature
- Conditional notifications such as doors open, precipitation, Home Assistant and Synology updates etc.

Few notifications that can be visible on the sidebar and mobile notification view:

- Heat pump alarm
- Doors open
- High CO2
- High and low indoor humidity
- High radon levels
- Garage dehumidifier on
- Current and today's precipitation
- Vacation mode on
- Synology security state warning
- Synology update available
- Home Assistant update available
- Vacuuming state
- Time to vacuum
- Vacuum dustbin is full

### Custom button cards

I have created few [button card templates](button_card_templates/troinine) for my own needs. To mention few:

- Generic info card with extra entity
- Generic sensor card
- Graph sensor card (graph displayed with mini-graph-card)
- Sidebar clock with date, time and weather
- Light card with a slider
- User card with device tracker and battery statuses
- Notification card that is used in the sidebar
- Vacuum card with buttons to control the robot vacuum
- Media card with buttons to control the media player
- Conditional card which allows flexible way of conditionally showing or hiding a card

All cards try to incorporate similar design. Icons can glow based on the state and the light card has a glowing box shadow when the respective light is on.

#### Clock

Clock is a button card template that show the current date, time, temperature, and weather

![Clock](/assets/images/screenshot-clock.png)

The tap action on the weather shows the following popup which uses [weather-chart-card](https://github.com/Yevgenium/weather-chart-card) and an apexchart of outdoor temperature:

![Weather](/assets/images/screenshot-weather.png)

### Automations

In addition to basic lights on / off based on movement. There are few automations that I use

- Wake up tablet and increase light brightness when movement is detected in the hallway
- Notify mobile app if the garage dehumidifier's bucket is full
- Turn hallway lights on when garage door is opened (arrive home)
- Start vacuuming when leaving home if it hasn't been done for few days
- Notify mobile app if the ground source heat pump reports an alarm
- Notify mobile app when Radon levels are increasing
- Notify mobile app when vacuum is started and completed
